ADAccountCreateBKTECH
=====================

Brooklyn Tech needed user accounts created for every computer in the school. This created 34 user accounts in an OU that was precreated. It also sets the password to blank for the accounts and sets user account so that it is only allowed to login to one computer that matches it's username. Rough script I made in 30 minues.
